Appcelerator Titanium Mobile is a great way to create iPhone and Android applications using JavaScript.

The only problem with it is that it doesn't have a source code editor, with code hinting and other features.
This plugin lets you use Dreamweaver to edit your Titanium JavaScript files.

This plugin supports version 1.5.1 of the Appcelerator API.
